# Portfolio

VozFeliz Student Portal:
I developed a student portal for a vocal training coach's website. Using PHP, I created a 
page that recognized who was currently signed in and if they are new, it creates a 
directory for them. Then you can upload their files into their directory and they will be 
displayed on their site. Also I helped fix the majority of the visual aspects of the 
website.

Suggest.java:
This program is used to demonstrate a suggestion algoritm similar to how a music streaming 
service suggests the next song to play based on the current song. For this demo, the songs
are represented by the alphabet and it generates multiple random lists of letters that act
as playlists. Then it waits on the user to type in a letter and then the program generates
a list of suggested songs.

MusicApp:
This program simulates a music streaming service by creating a library using a csv file
where each line has information about a song. Then the library breaks down different ways
in which a user can look up a song such as genre, artist, name, or album. Then by using a
graphical interface, the user can look for a song and then a list is generate based on if
the string that the user entered exists in the the library in either the genre, artist, 
name, or album.
